    <h1>We love urban photography</h1>
    <p>We’re betting you do too. Welcome to our site, a growing collection of galleries taken by a small group of passionate urban photographers. Visit our galleries, buy some of our prints, or drop us a line. While you’re at it, feel free to submit a gallery of your own. <strong>Welcome</strong>.</p>

    <h1>Welcome to Desolve</h1>
    <p>So what is Desolve? The short answer is that it comes from the combination of <strong>design</strong> and <strong>evolve</strong>, something we hope we're doing constantly. A slightly longer version is that we're a collection of photographers, designers, and creatives who enjoy urban photography. During our travels around the country, we take time to document the cities we love. You'll also occasionally find articles on design, our thoughts on the latest trends, and the odd posting on photography. </p>
    <h2>So... what aren't we?</h2>
    <p>Professional photographers, for one. Please keep in mind that we're strictly amateur photographers. We submit these galleries out of love and creative expression. We're not likely to remember the settings we took the picture at, or even what lens we had. We're also not very exclusive. If you like what you see here, and want to participate, we'd love to have you. All galleries, articles, and posts go through a submittal and approval process, so if you're interested, drop us a line and tell us what you have in mind.</p>
    <p>We also occasionally have meetups. If, for example, we know we're coming to Miami, we'll let everyone know and schedule a meet up day to tour the city and take photos. If you'd like us to visit your city, <a href="contact.htm" title="get in touch">let us know!</a></p>

    <h2>Photographers rights</h2>
    <p>Due to the heightened security concerns around the country, it has become common to find photographers routinely challenged when taking photographs in public places. With that in mind, we invite you to join us in a free forum as noted photographer Shea Hansen presents "Photographer's Rights in a Post 9/11 World."</p>
    <p>Shea will discuss what your rights are when taking photos in a public space. Following her talk we'll have an open forum where you can ask questions, compare experiences, and become better informed as to what your responsibilities are as amateur photographers.</p>
    <p>The forum will be held at the Cheek-Chastain Gallery, 227 West 29th Street in Manhattan on March 19th as part of their "Engage" lecture series</p>
