<h1>Line height</h1>
<p>Leading, or line spacing, is controlled in CSS through the line-height property. You can use any unit of measurement with line-height, and it is unique in that it allows you to use a &quot;multiple&quot; value as well. Multiples are a single number with no unit of measurement specified, the number simply acts as a multiple of the current element's font-size.</p>
<h2>How it's calculated</h2>
<p>The line-height value is used to specify the minimal height of line boxes within an element. If you want to visualize an element's line box, simply place a background color behind an element element with no padding. <span>Like this text, for example, which is in a span tag.</span> The minimum height is determined by calculating the minimum height above the baseline and a minimum height below it.</p>
<h2 class="center">Other uses</h2>
<p>Line-height is often used to center single line text vertically within a box. Take the above headline, by giving it a background color and a line-height to either match or set the element's height, and the text is vertically centered, as it &quot;floats&quot; in the middle of it's line-height. Try it!</p>
<h2>Things to consider</h2>
<p>If you use relative units of measurement with line-height, or a multiple, the value is calculated based on the font-size of the element it is applied to. If no font-size is explicitly set, the font-size of the parent element is used. In the case of element's inheriting line-height, they usually inherit the calculated value, meaning that if you set a parent element to 1em, that value will be calculated and passed down to all child elements. However, if you set line-height in multiples, the multiple itself is passed down, letting the children calculate  line-height values from their own font-size.</p>
